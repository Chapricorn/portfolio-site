<p>Hello, my name is Kou Cha. I am going to tell you a little about myself. I was born in Laos in 1980 up in the mountains in a house made out of straws and bamboos. My families were farmers and never went to school for many generations so my siblings and I have never seen how the cities looked like until after we moved to Thailand in 1986. Because my families have been farmers for many generations, we have a lot of siblings. I have a total of 12 siblings. People think the war was over by 1975, but for the people that were living there, it was never over. The on-going Vietnam War, also known as "The Private War" led the people who helped fought with the U.S. escaping to other nearby countries. My families and other people around us were dying and getting killed so we were fored to flee to Thailand or get killed. Because of this reason, I lost
2 younger brothers and a younger sister.

<br>We moved to Thailand in 1986, 11 years after the U.S. left Laos in 1975. My families lived in Thailand for 3 years as Refugees in many Refugee Camps, foods and shelters were provided by the United Nations. Then in 1989, we were fortunated that my uncle who came to the U.S. much much earlier; finally were able to get all required papers to sponsor us to the States.
<br><br>
Two months after we arrived in Wisconsin in January of 1989, I was enrolled for school. Since I don't speak English at all, my parents asked to hold me back 2 years. I started school 1st grade but when I finally graduated from High School in 2000, I was almost 20 years old already. I was alot older than my classmates, but nobody knew how old I was except my teachers. 

<br><br>After I graduated from High School, I went to UW-Milwauke for a year and year Majoring in Computer Science. Six months after I started school, I had my first child. It was very hard for me because I was doing full time school and full time work for about a year and a half along with helping my wife take care of our child. And because English is my second language, it was evn harder for me to keep up with school work and work at the same time. Few months after I had my first child, I was falling behind on my classes so I decided that dropping out of school was best for me and my family. 
<br><br>I waited about 3 years after I dropped out of school before I started going back to school for my Associates Degree at MATC. Because my wife and I had more kids, it took me longer than just 2 years for my Associates Degree. It took me about 6 years. I finally got my Associates in e-Business in 2010, but was very hard to find a job in that field because I didnt have the experiences that companies were looking for. Most jobs required at least a BA Degree or at least 5 or more years of experiences. After a year of looking for jobs, I didnt have too much choices but to go back to do factory jobs doing hard labor for little wages.
<br><br>One day I came accross an ad in Facebook about DevCode Camp and noticed that the ads had 3 of my cousins in there. I called each one of them about the course at DevCode to see if it's something I can do. I have a lot of doubts about myself taking the course because its been about 6 years since the last time a did any codings, but took the chance anyways. It was one of the biggest risks I have taken. I have to quit my job and basically put my life on hold for DevCode. I took a tour and felt that it's something I do and decided to enroll and quit my job. I dont know how I will do, but I guess we will see and find out. Its only my 3rd day...lol</p>
